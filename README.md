## Ex3 – Part 2: Implementation of Core Game Loop

**Objective**: 

To implement the core gameplay mechanics of the classic game Flappy Bird. This includes the continuous spawning of obstacles (pipes), movement of the bird controlled by player input and collision detection with pipes. The implementation will focus on creating a repetitive gameplay loop that defines the game's primary challenge and interaction.

**Gameplay Instructions**: 
1. *Controls:*
   * Press the spacebar to make the bird jump.
   * Time your jumps carefully to pass through gaps between the pipes.
2. *Goals:*
   * Keep the bird flying as long as possible.
   * Avoid hitting the pipes or falling to the ground.
3. *Game Over:*
   * Upon collision with a pipe, the game transitions to the GameOver scene.

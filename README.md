## Ex3 – Part 2: Implementation of Core Game Loop

**Objective**: 

To implement the core gameplay mechanics of the classic game Flappy Bird. This includes the continuous spawning of obstacles (pipes), movement of the bird controlled by player input and collision detection with pipes. The implementation will focus on creating a repetitive gameplay loop that defines the game's primary challenge and interaction.
